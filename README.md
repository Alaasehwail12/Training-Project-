# Training-Project (User-library System) (Full Stack)-
-This project is to build a web page dedicated to booking books from the library, where a new user account is created through a POST API carrying all the user information, which is then entered into the created database. After the login process, the user is directed to the main interface of the page, which contains all the books available for reservation (entered using a POST API). The user can only reserve two books at a time and can cancel the reservation. Consequently, the canceled reservation appears on the main page for other users to book. Additionally, users have the ability to edit their personal information and other properties. Using this project, I learned a lot about Spring Boot and Angular.
-For this project, I utilized IntelliJ IDEA as my Integrated Development Environment (IDE) to implement the database using Spring Boot. Additionally, I employed PgAdmin4 to manage the PostgreSQL database. For the front-end development, I utilized Android Studio for creating the user interfaces with Angular.
